# Getting Rid of Social Media!

So, after over 10 years of constantly checking up on my Social Media accounts, I've decided to finally delete them all!

I'm generally a 'lurker'. I'm no facebook extravert or twitter socialite with thousands of followers, nor do I aim to be. But I do like to keep up with whats going on in my friend and family circles. At least that was what Facebook started as right.
