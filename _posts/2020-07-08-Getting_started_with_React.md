# Getting started in React as a beginner.

After studying HTML, CSS and Javascript basics for the last 3 months, I decided to take the leap into the exciting world of React. I've seen a lot of do's and don'ts on Twitter, so I thought I'd share my experiences after the first week of learning. 
I started out with a course on Udemy.com by Mosh Hamedani. I've watched a handful of his Javascript videos on YouTube when I was learning the language and felt his presentation of the material is clear and to the point so jumped at his React course. 
I delved into this course with a decent understanding of Javascript fundementals and a fairly basic grasp of ES6 and other more advanced concepts. I felt that I wanted to take the leap into the framework after reading quite a lot of differing viewpoints on Twitter. It seemed there were a whole host of people in the camp of "make sure you have a strong understanding of JS basics". Whilst there were also a vast amount of people claiming they had learned React and picked up JS along the way. Taking this into account, knowing I wanted to work in React going forward, I decided to jump straight in with the knowledge I have.
