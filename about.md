# Find out about me!

Hi, my name is Daniel Berry. I am a 33 year old Managing Director of an Air Conditioning installation company based in Leeds in the UK. I am also a software developer in my spare time. I embarked on this journey in March 2020 and created this blog in July 2020 to document the learning process. This is more for cementing my own knowledge than for anyone else, but if you are here, thanks for reading!
